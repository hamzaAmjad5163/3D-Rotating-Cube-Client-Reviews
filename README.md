## Concept: 
Design a rotating 3D cube or cylinder where each face displays a different review. Users can click arrows or swipe to rotate the shape and reveal different reviews.
## Design Idea:
Each face of the 3D shape (cube, cylinder, etc.) holds one review.
On click or swipe, the shape rotates to show the next review.
## Styling: 
Use CSS transform properties for the 3D effect and JavaScript to handle rotation on click.
